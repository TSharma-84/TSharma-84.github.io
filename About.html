		   I am IT Engineer by Qualification and an Artist by heart. I am always seen as Autodidact who keeps on learning new things by his own. I am also inclined towards 3d Art and Game Development. 

		   Having worked as a Software Developer for over 6 years, Web Development is a natural fit for my skill sets, wherein I can use my dual experience of being Developer and Artist.
